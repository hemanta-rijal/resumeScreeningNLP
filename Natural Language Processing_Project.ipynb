we have to visualize that data and find the usage pattern form it and have a generate a reports image based fraud detection microsoft face api pyspark open cv the main goal of project is recognize similarity for a face to given database images face recognition is the recognizing a special face from set of different faces face is extracted and then compared with the database image if that image recognized then the person already applied for loan from somewhere else and now hiding his or her identity this is how we are going to prevent the frauds in the initial stage itself churn analysis for

    "I implement the two model (we can dynamically add more model on it) i.e RandomForestClassifier and support vector classifier. While evaulating the classification report, Support Vector classification report gives more precision (Accuracy of positive predictions), more recall (Fraction of positives that were correctly identified.) and more accuracy than random forest classifier.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, I did   kFold cross validation for model and calcualte the R2 score, which also gives better result for support vector. \n",
    "Hence although, both model perform extremely well (more than 90%) , support vector performs well and gives the best result. Therefor I choose support vector for production. "
